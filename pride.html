  <p class="racedesc">"WHAT DOES LGBTQ+ MEAN?" is really informative because it explains what LGBT+ is and its full form. If you scroll down there are the terms of everything in it and what they mean. It's really easy to understand and full of information.</p><br>

  <p class="racedesc">In this video Wanda Sykes explains to another person, Mark, the history of LGBT+ and where it started. She goes through the times people were accepting and the times that the community had to fight back and to the present, right now and where we are.</p><br>

  <h3>What can you do?</h3>
  <p>You can respect people's sexual orientation and pronouns. Know that there are also going to be many people that are still figuring out their identity. Your job is to make those people feel comfortable with themselves and not to stress them out or pressure them to decide something or to tell you something. There are also still many people that are against these views and lgbtqia+, if you see someone being disrespectful to another individual about the way they feel about someone or how they think of themselves maybe go out of your way to stand up for them. A lot of people that don't match what society sometimes dictates as the "norm" for who someone should love or what gender someone needs to be really hurts them deeply. You should try to stand up for these people and treat them like normal humans because that's what they are, humans.</p>
