  <h3>What can you do?</h3>
  <p>There are so many ways we can help the environment. We need to stop using as many fossil fuels as they are really bad for the planet. One way we could all pitch in is by recycling and composting. Recycling could reduce a lot of the plastic and metals in the ocean and landfills if people just took the time to see if what was in their hands had a small sticker that showed they could recycle it. Composting also reduces the amount of waste in landfills and oceans because a lot of leftovers from food and fruit peels can be composted and it can help your plants grow and it reduces waste. You can advocate for people to litter less and to help pick up trash. Now I couldn't possibly list all of the ways to help our environment because there are just so many, but you can research and find countless ways to help Earth that may only take seconds for you and leave lasting impact on our precious planet.</p>
