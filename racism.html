  <h3>What can you do?</h3>
  <p>You can advocate for people. Some of these people getting attacked don't have a voice and you can be that for them by promoting black-owned businesses. You can support small businesses that are run by black people. You can be more welcoming to your peers' culture and the way they do things or why they may do things differently than you. Just don't treat people differently if they have a different skin color than you.</p>
