  <h3>What can you do?</h3>
  <p>To make all genders viewed equally we all need to erase the stigmas surrounding each one. A way you could help is by promoting and supporting female-owned businesses. There are still many places in the world that don't respect women and girls or their rights. These are the kinds of places you want to reach out to and give people voices and talk about the women and girls there. You can research and find out which one of our leaders or which organizations to contact if you want to help out in any way with making all genders viewed the same.</p>
