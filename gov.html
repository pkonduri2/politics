  <h3>What can you do?</h3>
  <p>If this topic interests you, you should do more research to learn about it! There is so much to learn about our government and many others around the world. Each one functions differently and has some strong spots and some weaknesses. Some focus more on their people, others may focus more on their economy or army. There is just a lot to learn about governments and if you want to advocate for a topic you're passionate about reaching out to our leaders --senators, representatives, the president-- is all a good idea if you need someone to listen to you and your voice.</p>
