  <p class="racedesc">In this video by Jubilee in their series “Middle Ground”  people from both sides of the gun rights conversation, pro gun and anti gun, come together to talk about their views on guns, why it is that way, and what they want to do to change it. Did this video change your mind? Do you think there is a way to achieve peace and make both sides happy?</p>

  <h3>What can you do?</h3>
  <p>I think there is no "right" side to this argument. There are going to be many people that are pro gun and many people that are anti gun, you need to respect people's views about these topics unless it endangers anyone of course. You should do research and think about where you stand in this argument. You also don't have to have an opinion about this, it's fine if you can't choose between whether or not you support people having guns because there are strong points to each side of the argument. Just respect everyone's opinion.</p>
